## 🔍 Overview

This project is a simple, responsive QR code card component built with **semantic HTML** and **mobile-first CSS**.
The goal was to practice layout techniques, CSS variables, and clean project structure.

## ⚙️ My Process
### 🛠 Built With

- Semantic HTML5

- CSS Custom Properties (Variables)

- Flexbox

- Mobile-first workflow

- Google Fonts (Outfit)

- BEM-style class naming

- Modular CSS architecture

## 📘 What I Learned

**While building this project, I practiced:**

- Structuring CSS using multiple files and imports

- Using CSS variables for consistent design tokens

- Building layouts with Flexbox

- Applying a mobile-first approach

- Writing cleaner and more readable HTML with semantic elements

**Example of CSS variables usage:**

```css
:root {
  --color-Slate-900: #1F314F;
  --space-md: 1.5rem;
}
```
## 🚀 Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to:

- Improve accessibility (ARIA roles, better contrast checks)

- Add more responsive breakpoints

- Explore CSS Grid for more complex layouts

- Optimize CSS architecture for larger projects
